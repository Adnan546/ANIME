    <b>What is Anime</b>
    </main>
    </p>The term anime [a·nuh·mei] is a Japanese colloquialism used as an abbreviation for the term “animation.” Generally in Japan, the word anime (written アニメ) is synonymous with animation of any kind from anywhere. Internationally, however, anime is typically referred to as animation that is produced from Japan. The distinction between anime and cartoons is more cultural than it is technical and its origins date over 100 years ago.</p>
